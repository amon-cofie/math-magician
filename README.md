# Math Magician

> This is a low fidelity wireframe of a single page calculator app built with react

## Built With

- React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Prerequisites

- Code editor
- Install Git
- Command Line Interface
- Basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript
- Web browser
- npm

### Setup

- Open your command line and change directory to the destination on your local computer where you want your copy to be stored (You can use the terminal in VS code).
- Copy this command to your command line or terminal: **git clone https://github.com/amon-cofie/math-magician.git**
- Change directory to the repository. You can use this command in the command line: **cd math-magician**
- The content of the repository should appear in the your code editor at this point if you are using the inbuilt terminal.
- You can open the repository from git bash in VS code at this point with the following command: **code .**
- You should make any desired changes in the "src" folder and try as much as possible not to change the configurations in the package.json and webpack.config.js files
